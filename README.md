# Repository Containing the analysis for EDS 222 Statistics for Environmental Data Science Final Project 


The aim of this project is to investigate the impact of hurricanes on the annual percentage of GDP growth in The Bahamas. Growing up in The Bahamas, I have witnessed first hand the devastating impacts of hurricanes on livelihoods throughout the country and have been an active participant in recovery efforts every time my island was struck. Natural disasters have massive economic costs and take a deep toll on growth prospects because reconstruction costs monopolize already scarce resources for health, education, and social spending, especially in developing countries.

There is existing research on the impact of hurricanes on GDP growth in the United States but this project will look specifically at The Bahamas. With the global changing climate and the continual impact of stronger hurricanes on Caribbean countries, answering this question can have important implications for the future of small island developing states like The Bahamas.
